# Feature Specification: UI/UX Improvements for Task Management

**Feature Branch**: `004-lets-improve-our`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "lets improve our app according to these feedback items: 1. Simplify the Token Syntax Display

The token help text below the input field is overwhelming and hard to read:
Tokens: #project !p0..p3 due:today|tomorrow|YYYY-MM-DD|HH:mm @ai @me +tag impact:0..5 urgency:0..5 effort:0..5 expect:today|YYYY-MM-DD
Suggestion: Hide this by default and show it in a collapsible tooltip/popover triggered by a \"?\" icon. Users who need it can access it; new users aren't intimidated.

2. Add Visual Hierarchy for Task Priority

Currently, all tasks look similar with just \"P3\" labels. Priority is hard to spot at a glance.

Suggestion: Use color-coded borders or backgrounds for different priorities:

- P0/P1: Red/orange accent
- P2: Yellow accent
- P3: Default/gray

This enables instant visual scanning of critical tasks.

3. Improve Empty Column States

Empty columns like \"Waiting on Others\" and \"In Review\" just show blank space with subtle borders, making the board feel sparse.

Suggestion: Add helpful empty state messages with suggested actions:

- \"Waiting on Others\" ‚Üí \"No blockers yet üëç\"
- \"In Review\" ‚Üí \"Ready for PR review\"

4. Make Task Actions More Discoverable

The \"Move left/right\" and timer buttons only appear on hover, and their purpose isn't immediately clear without icons.

Suggestion:

- Always show a subtle drag handle icon (‚ãÆ‚ãÆ) on cards
- Use clearer icons: ‚Üê ‚Üí for move, ‚ñ∂ for timer
- Add a quick action menu (‚ãØ) that's always visible

5. Enhance the Quick Add Experience

The \"Add Task\" button is small and the input field doesn't provide real-time feedback as you type tokens.

Suggestion:

- Show inline token preview as you type (e.g., typing \"#alpha\" shows a badge preview)
- Make the input expand/highlight when focused
- Add autocomplete suggestions for @owners, #projects, and +tags as you type
- Consider making Enter key submit the form (currently requires clicking \"Add Task\")"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: UI improvements, visual feedback, discoverability, empty states, help text
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí None - all improvements are clearly specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow is clear for each improvement
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí No new data entities - UI improvements only
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements are clear and implementation-agnostic
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a task board user, I need clearer visual cues and more intuitive interactions so that I can manage tasks more efficiently without confusion or unnecessary cognitive load. The current interface has hidden help text, unclear priorities, bare empty states, hard-to-find actions, and limited input feedback that slow down my workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Token Help Discovery**

1. **Given** I am a new user viewing the task input field, **When** I look at the interface, **Then** I should see a clean input area without overwhelming text
2. **Given** I need help with token syntax, **When** I click a help icon near the input, **Then** I should see comprehensive token documentation in a readable format
3. **Given** I have reviewed the token help, **When** I click outside or dismiss the help, **Then** it should hide and not clutter my workspace

**Scenario 2: Priority Visual Scanning**

1. **Given** I have tasks with different priorities on my board, **When** I scan the board view, **Then** I should immediately identify high-priority tasks by their distinct visual styling
2. **Given** a task is P0 or P1, **When** displayed on the board, **Then** it should have red or orange visual accent
3. **Given** a task is P2, **When** displayed on the board, **Then** it should have yellow visual accent
4. **Given** a task is P3, **When** displayed on the board, **Then** it should have default or gray styling

**Scenario 3: Empty Column Clarity**

1. **Given** a column has no tasks, **When** I view that column, **Then** I should see a helpful message explaining the column state or suggesting actions
2. **Given** the "Waiting on Others" column is empty, **When** I view it, **Then** I should see an encouraging message indicating no blockers
3. **Given** the "In Review" column is empty, **When** I view it, **Then** I should see a contextual message about PR review readiness

**Scenario 4: Task Action Discoverability**

1. **Given** I am viewing a task card, **When** I look at the card, **Then** I should see clear visual indicators for available actions without needing to hover
2. **Given** I want to move a task, **When** I look at task actions, **Then** I should see directional arrow icons indicating movement options
3. **Given** I want to start a timer, **When** I look at task actions, **Then** I should see a play icon indicating timer functionality
4. **Given** I want to drag a task, **When** I look at the card, **Then** I should see a drag handle icon indicating the card is movable

**Scenario 5: Quick Add Feedback**

1. **Given** I am typing in the task input field, **When** I enter a token like "#alpha", **Then** I should see a visual preview of that token as I type
2. **Given** I need to assign an owner, **When** I type "@", **Then** I should see autocomplete suggestions for available owners
3. **Given** I need to add a project, **When** I type "#", **Then** I should see autocomplete suggestions for existing projects
4. **Given** I need to add a tag, **When** I type "+", **Then** I should see autocomplete suggestions for existing tags
5. **Given** I have entered task details, **When** I press Enter key, **Then** the task should be created without requiring a button click
6. **Given** I focus on the input field, **When** the field receives focus, **Then** it should expand or highlight to indicate active state

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no existing owners/projects/tags for autocomplete? System should allow free-text entry
- What happens if help tooltip is open and user starts typing? Tooltip should auto-dismiss to keep focus on the input field and reduce visual clutter
- How should priority colors appear in both light and dark mode? Colors must be accessible in both themes
- What happens if task has no priority set? System should show default styling (P3 equivalent)
- What if empty state messages are too long for narrow columns? Messages should be concise and responsive
