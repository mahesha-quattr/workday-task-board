# Feature Specification: Owner Add-Edit-Remove

**Feature Branch**: `002-owner-add-edit`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Owner add-edit-remove: i should be able to add new owners, remove owners or transfer task ownership to someone else."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user working with tasks in the Kanban board, I want to assign ownership to tasks and manage who is responsible for them. This includes adding new owners to tasks, removing owners from tasks, and transferring complete ownership from one person to another, so that task accountability is clear and can be updated as responsibilities change.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a task exists without any owner, **When** user adds an owner to the task, **Then** the owner's name appears on the task and is persisted
2. **Given** a task has an existing owner, **When** user adds another owner, **Then** the task shows multiple owners
3. **Given** a task has one or more owners, **When** user removes an owner, **Then** that owner is no longer associated with the task
4. **Given** a task has an owner "Alice", **When** user transfers ownership to "Bob", **Then** Alice is removed and Bob becomes the sole owner
5. **Given** a user is viewing the board, **When** tasks have owners assigned, **Then** owner information is clearly visible on each task card
6. **Given** multiple tasks exist with owners, **When** user filters or searches by owner name, **Then** only tasks assigned to that owner are displayed
7. **Given** a user tries to add an owner name that already exists in the task, **When** attempting to add the duplicate, **Then** the system prevents the duplicate and shows an appropriate message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user tries to remove the last/only owner from a task? Task can exist without any owners
- How does system handle duplicate owner names within the same task? System prevents adding the same owner name twice to a single task
- What happens to ownership when a task is deleted? Ownership data is deleted along with the task
- How does ownership interact with task archival/completion? Ownership remains unchanged when task moves to Done column
- What happens when transferring ownership to the same person who already owns it? Transfer is prevented with appropriate feedback

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add multiple owners to any task
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to remove existing owners from tasks
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a way to transfer complete ownership from one person to another in a single action
- **FR-004**: System MUST display owner information visibly on task cards
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist owner assignments across sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide an interface to manage owners (inline on task cards or in task edit modal)
- **FR-007**: System MUST accept free text entry for owner names
- **FR-008**: Owner changes MUST be immediately reflected in the UI without page refresh
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent duplicate owner names within the same task
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow tasks to exist without any owners
- **FR-011**: System MUST support filtering tasks by owner name
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow multiple concurrent owners per task

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Owner**: Represents a person responsible for a task, identified by their name (free text string, case-sensitive, no duplicates within same task)
- **Task**: Existing entity that will be extended to include a list of owner names, maintaining zero or more owners per task
- **Owner Assignment**: The relationship between a task and its owner(s), stored as an array of owner names on each task
