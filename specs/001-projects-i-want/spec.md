# Feature Specification: Projects Module

**Feature Branch**: `001-projects-i-want`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Projects: I want to add a Projects module in this project, where User can manage different task lists for different projects. user should be able to add, delete projects, that project should be very top level filter, inside that there will be other items."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user managing multiple work streams, I want to organize my tasks into separate projects so that I can focus on specific contexts and maintain clear boundaries between different initiatives.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is on the task board, **When** they create a new project named "Q1 Marketing Campaign", **Then** the project appears in the project selector and can be selected as the active view
2. **Given** a user has created multiple projects, **When** they select a specific project from the selector, **Then** only tasks associated with that project are displayed in the board columns
3. **Given** a user has an active project with tasks, **When** they delete the project, **Then** all tasks associated with that project are permanently deleted after confirmation
4. **Given** a user is viewing a specific project, **When** they create a new task, **Then** the task is automatically associated with the currently selected project
5. **Given** a user has tasks across multiple projects, **When** they switch between projects, **Then** the board updates to show only tasks for the selected project with column states persisting globally (not per-project)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to delete the default project? System displays an error message indicating the default project cannot be deleted
- How does the system handle project names that are duplicates? System prevents duplicate names with an inline validation error
- What is the maximum number of projects a user can create? No limit on project count
- Can tasks be moved between projects after creation? Yes, users can select multiple tasks and move them to a different project via a context menu or bulk action
- What happens to active timers when switching projects? Timers continue running as they are task-specific, and a small indicator shows if a timer is active in another project

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new projects with a user-defined name
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a way to delete existing projects with a confirmation dialog that shows the number of tasks that will be deleted
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a project selector that shows all available projects
- **FR-004**: System MUST filter the task board to show only tasks belonging to the currently selected project
- **FR-005**: New tasks created while a project is selected MUST be automatically associated with that project
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist project data and project-task associations across browser sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST permanently delete all tasks associated with a project when that project is deleted (after confirmation)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a permanent "Default" project that cannot be deleted, where new users start
- **FR-009**: Project names MUST be unique, limited to 15 characters, and can contain letters, numbers, spaces, and basic punctuation
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to rename existing projects (except the Default project) via an inline edit or settings menu
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain existing board functionality (columns, priority, timers) within each project context
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to select multiple tasks and bulk move them to a different project
- **FR-013**: System MUST show a visual indicator when a task timer is running in a project different from the currently viewed one
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate project names for uniqueness and length constraints with immediate feedback

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Project**: Represents a distinct work context or initiative that groups related tasks. Contains a name, creation date, task count, and optional color/icon for visual distinction
- **Task-Project Association**: Links each task to exactly one project, establishing the filtering relationship for project-based views
- **Project Selection State**: Tracks which project is currently active for viewing and task creation

## UI/UX Design Decisions

### Project Selector

- **Location**: Top-left of the interface, prominent but not intrusive, positioned before the main board title
- **Style**: Dropdown selector with the current project name displayed, including a small colored dot/icon for visual identification
- **Quick Access**: Shows 5 most recent projects at top, then alphabetical list, with search functionality for 10+ projects
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Current project name in bold with subtle background, dropdown shows project names with task counts (e.g., "Marketing (24 tasks)")

### Project Management Interface

- **Access Point**: Settings icon next to project selector opens a slide-out panel or modal for project management
- **Project List View**: Cards or list items showing project name, task count, creation date, with inline edit and delete actions
- **Create Project**: Prominent "New Project" button at top of project list, opens inline form with real-time validation
- **Delete Confirmation**: Modal dialog showing project name, task count, and clear warning about permanent deletion with red-styled confirm button

### Task-Project Association UI

- **Visual Indicators**: Small colored project badge on task cards matching project color
- **Bulk Move**: Multi-select mode activated by checkbox appearance on hover, with action bar appearing at bottom
- **Move Dialog**: Shows source and target projects with task preview and count
- **Drag Behavior**: When dragging tasks between columns, project association remains unchanged unless explicitly moved

### Cross-Project Awareness

- **Active Timer Indicator**: Small pulsing dot in project selector when timer is active in another project
- **Quick Timer Jump**: Clicking the indicator switches to the project with active timer and highlights the task
- **Project Switch Confirmation**: If unsaved changes exist, prompt user before switching projects

### Visual Design Patterns

- **Color System**: Each project gets an auto-assigned color from a curated palette (can be changed), used consistently in badges, selectors, and indicators
- **Empty States**: Friendly messaging when no tasks in project, with quick-add suggestions
- **Responsive Behavior**: On mobile, project selector becomes a hamburger menu item with full-screen project switcher
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Cmd/Ctrl + K for quick project search, Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N for new project

### Information Architecture

- **Default Project**: Always listed first, with lock icon indicating it cannot be deleted or renamed
- **Project Ordering**: User-customizable drag-to-reorder, persisted across sessions
- **Search & Filter**: Project selector includes type-to-search with fuzzy matching on project names
- **Context Preservation**: Remember last viewed project and restore on next visit
