# Feature Specification: Enhanced Owner Management System

**Feature Branch**: `003-we-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we need to update 002-owner-add-edit, its doesnt have any place to centrally manage all owners, we cannot select existing owners for a particular task. also we are not persisting owners for a task. there are so many similar issues"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user managing tasks in the Kanban board, I need a comprehensive owner management system that allows me to:

1. View and manage all owners in a central location
2. Select from existing owners when assigning tasks (avoiding typos and duplicates)
3. Ensure owner assignments persist across sessions
4. Have a consistent and reliable way to manage task ownership across the application

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a list of existing owners in the system, **When** user assigns an owner to a task, **Then** they can select from a dropdown/autocomplete of existing owners
2. **Given** a task with assigned owners, **When** user refreshes the page or returns later, **Then** the owner assignments are still present
3. **Given** the need to manage owners, **When** user accesses owner management, **Then** they can view all owners in the system
4. **Given** an owner exists in the system, **When** user types a partial name, **Then** the system suggests matching owners
5. **Given** multiple tasks with owners, **When** user views owner list, **Then** they can see which tasks are assigned to each owner
6. **Given** a new owner name not in the system, **When** user enters it, **Then** system adds it to the central owner registry
7. **Given** an owner with no assigned tasks, **When** viewing owner management, **Then** user can remove that owner from the system
8. **Given** task creation via quick-add with @owner tokens, **When** page is refreshed, **Then** owner assignments persist

### Edge Cases

- What happens when removing an owner who has tasks assigned? Tasks will have that owner unassigned
- How does system handle case sensitivity in owner names? (e.g., "Bob" vs "bob")
- What is the maximum number of owners per task? Limited to 5 owners per task
- How should system handle duplicate owner names during import/bulk operations?
- What happens to owner data during task deletion?
- Owner name validation: Maximum 30 characters per owner name

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a central location to view all owners in the system
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select from existing owners when assigning to tasks
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist owner assignments for tasks across page refreshes and sessions
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide autocomplete/suggestions when typing owner names
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain a registry of all unique owners across all tasks
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow adding new owners to the registry
- **FR-007**: System MUST show owner usage statistics (number of tasks per owner)
- **FR-008**: System MUST unassign owner from all tasks when that owner is removed from registry
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent duplicate owner entries in the registry
- **FR-010**: System MUST support bulk assignment of a single owner to multiple selected tasks
- **FR-011**: System MUST enforce maximum of 5 owners per task
- **FR-012**: System MUST integrate owner selection with quick-add functionality
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide owner filtering and search capabilities
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate owner data integrity on load
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate owner names to maximum 30 characters

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Owner Registry**: Central collection of all unique owner names in the system, with metadata such as task count and last used date
- **Owner**: Individual person who can be assigned to tasks, with name (max 30 characters) and active task count
- **Task-Owner Assignment**: Relationship between tasks and owners, supporting up to 5 owners per task
- **Owner Statistics**: Aggregated data about owner usage including total task count per owner

## Notes

This specification enhances the existing 002-owner-add-edit feature by addressing critical gaps:

1. **Central Owner Management**: Currently missing a unified place to view/manage all owners
2. **Owner Selection UI**: No way to select from existing owners (forcing retyping)
3. **Data Persistence Issues**: Owner assignments not properly persisting
4. **Registry Management**: No central registry of owners across the system
5. **User Experience**: Inconsistent owner entry leading to duplicates and typos

### Key Decisions:

- Maximum 5 owners per task to maintain UI clarity and performance
- Owner names limited to 30 characters for display consistency
- Removing an owner from registry will unassign them from all tasks (no orphaned references)
- Bulk operations focus on assigning one owner to multiple tasks (most common use case)
- No owner history tracking or merging features (keeping system simple)
